## expected structure of `radiostations.json`:

```json
{
    "station name 1": {
        "time": "hh:mm",
        "url": ""
    },
    "station name 2": {
        "time": "hh:mm",
        "url": ""
    },
}
```

- `time`: time to play this station, when automation is enabled | can be empty
- `url`: url of the audiostream | should not be empty
